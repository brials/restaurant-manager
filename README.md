# Restaurant-Manager


Restaurant Manager is an app that is designed to help a restaurant owner and their employees manage 1 or multiple restaurants.  It is built using React as the front end framework  It connects to the backend framework which I built using Express and MongoDB as my no SQL database. The Github repo for the backend can be found at https://github.com/brials/restaurant-api/.  This app was intended to be a place for me to practice my React.

Thank you very much for taking the time to look around.

### Known Issues
- The first customer added to a table does not immediately render but rather takes a refresh.
- Logout button does not redirect to login page if user did not login.
- User can still access home page without logging in. Loading screen just sits their permanently which may confuse user
- Way to delete menu item not built yet so menu items are permanent once added to a restaurant.
